To evaluate the reliability of our system, it was necessary to conduct data analysis and statistical tests to observe and analyse the real-time performance of the system. To this end, our group conducted a series of measurements to determine the time required to complete specific tasks and performed critical instant analysis to verify whether each task could be completed before the respective deadlines. To study the overall behaviour of the system, we collected statistics from the FreeRTOS() operating system to show the time the real-world performance of the operating system. The relevant code and timing is noted in the 

### 3.1 Methodology

To determine the timing requirements for tasks and interrupts, we computed the average execution time for each task across all 32 intervals.To determine the timing requirements for tasks and interrupts, we computed the average execution time for each task across all 32 intervals.This was then validated with the FreeRTOS stats buffer timer which appeared to show similar estimated time values when timed for. 
Figure 1 and 2 demonstrate the timing analysis of tasks in the system.

The aggregated timing statistics indicate consistent pattern wherein the displayUpdate() tasks exhibit significantly longer execution times compared to the other tasks. This can be attributed to the task's requirement to draw the relevant output on the display screen, which significantly increases the time required for this task. Additionally, the scanKeysTask() task exhibits relatively longer execution times, which is justifiable due to the need to scan through the keys, knobs, and joysticks, making this an overall time-consuming task.

## 3.2 Critical Instant Analysis

To determine the critical instant analysis of each task we need to determine both the deadlines and interrupt times of tasks within the system. We can determine the overall execution time of each task by taking the sum of our measured time and the relevant interrupt for the task (in figure 1).

For instance, the scanKeysTask() only has a single interrupt and hence the time taken for this task can be determined as follows:


$$ T_{scanKeysTask()} =\ T_{scankeysmeasured()} +\ T_{sampleISR} =\ 70.7\ +\ 11.3\ =\ 82.0\ \mu s $$

### 3.2.1 Determining Task Deadlines

The deadlines for the displayUpdateTask() and scanKeysTask() are definable based on the port max frequency from STM32 and primarily use the vTaskDelayUntil() parameter. In our implementation, we extended the scheduling interval for displayUpdateTask() to 100ms as per the specifications delineated and that it is acceptable to wait a period of 0.1s for a screen to update and it's a task of lower priority. Meanwhile, scanKeysTask() has the deadline of 50ms as was initially defined.  

### 3.2.2 Calculating Deadlines CAN Transmission

The CAN\_TX\_TASK has an explicit deadline that is contingent on the execution of the scanKeyTask(). This is because the CAN task is responsible for broadcasting the sounds to all the keyboards in the system.

Primarily the deadline for this task is defined as follows

$$ CAN_{TASK(deadline)}\ =(scan_{key_deadline\ })/(num_keys\ )=50ms/12=\ 4.167\ ms\  $$

This refers to the maximum allowable time for each CAN transmission.

Considering that the queue has a total length of 36, we can therefore assume the maximum time allowable for this task to be aggregated across 36 executions.

$$ Aggregated-deadline=Queue_{size} \ast CAN_{Task(Deadline)}\ =36\ast(50)\/12=150ms  $$

Likewise, for the decode task, the queue length is 36 and CAN messages can be sent at a rate of 0.7ms per message. 

### 3.2.3 Timing Analysis

After determining the interruptions and measured time per task, the following table was produced. Here, CAN\_TX\_TASK() and decodeTask() consider the aggregated time taken across 36 intervals.

| **Task Name and Time Including Interrupts** | **Initiation Time – Tau (ms)** | **Execution Time – Ti (&micro s)** | **Priority Assigned** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| scanKeys() | 50 | 82.0 | 2 |
| displayUpdate() | 100 | 15826 | 1 |
| CAN\_TX()* | 150 | 198.0 | 1 |
| decode()* | 25.2 | 154.1 | 1 |

* The executing and initiation times for the decode and CAN_TX task are averaged across 36 iterations. 

From the above table we can see that the priority assigned is the same for all 3 of the displayTask(), CAN\_TX\_TASK(), and decodeTask(). The decision to do this was because it is important to ensure that display can be adequately handled to provide an essential user-interface, and this is equally important as CAN\_TX\_TASK() and decodeTask(). CAN and decodeTask() are important too as we need to ensure that sound can be broadcasted to different speakers. We decided to base our analysis on the task with CAN_TX_TASK() as this is the one with longest deadline and hence means that other tasks will occur more than once at each iteration. It will also provide the largest CPU utilization and toughet deadline to meet theoretically. as they have equal initiation times and are all lowest priority tasks. 

### 3.2.4 Scan Key Task Timing

We can conduct a timing analysis for the Scan Key Task and Display Update Task as follows to calculate and assess the critical instant analysis. The CAN_TX() task is primarily what we use to assess and determine the relevant critical instants. 

$$ Tn_{scanKeys()} =T_{CAN\_TX()}/T_{scanKeys()}\ =150/50=\ 3\  $$ 

$$ Tn_{displayUpdate()} =T_{CAN\_TX()}/T_{displayUpdate()}\ =150/100=\ 1.5 --> 2\  $$ 

$$ Tn_{decodeTask()} = T_{CAN\_TX()}/T_{decodeTask()} = 150/25.2 = 5.952 -> 6 $$

Hence, we know 3 occurrences of scanKeysTask() will occur within the displayTask() deadline, 2 tasks of displayUpdate, and 3 tasks of decodeTask() in the relevant CAN_TX deadline.    

### 3.2.5 Latency Calculation

$$ Ln\ =\ T_{CAN-TX()}+\ T_{decode()}+\ 2T_{displayUpdate()}+\ 3\ast T_{scankeys()} $$

$$ \ \ \ \ =\ \ 198+6*154.1+2\ast(15826)+3\ast(82.0)=\ 33475.0\ \mu s $$

According to the latency calculation of the critical instant, we can observe how which results in the code being relatively safe according to time constraint requirements and critical timing path analysis. 33.475<150ms which corresponds to the deadline of lowest priority CAN_TX_TASK(). There should be sufficient time for the tasks to occur. Additionally, we can see that this is also significantly lower than the time for displayUpdate() deadline.

## 3.3 CPU Memory and Utilization

### 3.3.1 CPU Utilization

When considering the CPU utilisation, we assume that vTask scheduler can run all tasks in parallel and we can calculate the CPU utilisation by examining the execution times. We also consider the rate monotic scheduling system and priorities assigned to estimate this statistic: 

$$ CPU \ Utilization = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{Execution \ Time_i}{Deadline \ Time_i} [1] $$

Deadline Time = 150ms (as determined by displayUpdate() in this rate monotonic 


$$ \sum_{i=1}^n \text{Execution Time}_i = T_{\text{CAN\_TX}}() + 6 \cdot T_{\text{decode}}() + 2 \cdot T_{\text{displayUpdate}}() + 3 \cdot T_{\text{scanKeys}}() = 33.475 \ \mu s $$ 


Utilization = 33.475/150 = 22.31% (for a critical instant -- this was ascertained ).  

The overall CPU utilization statistic supports how the CPU is capable of comfortably executing all tasks by the deadline with potential leeway to add more tasks to the scheduler. However, there are some further considerations that may need to be observed. When timing this code, we do not explicitly wait for a free mailbox in CAN_TX_TASK (). Therefore, it is necessary and expected for our current CPU utilisation to be lower than in the real-time operating system. 


### 3.3.2 Stack Size Utilization

The stack size of a task affects CPU utilisation by determining the amount of memory reserved for each task to store function call information and local variables. Small stack sizes may lead to memory-related issues, while a large stack size wastes valuable memory resources. The optimal stack size maximizes CPU utilisation by balancing the number of available stacks and task switching overhead. 

We first calculate the total stack size used by all tasks: 64 + 256 + 32 + 32 = 384 words.  

Assume a word size of 4 bytes (32 bits) which results in a total stack size of 1536 bytes. 

This is relatively small compared to the total RAM available in the microcontroller suggesting that there is still room for increasing the stack size of individual tasks if needed. However, it is notable that increasing the stack size of a task will increase the total system stack size affecting the available RAM for other tasks; it’s important to balance the stack size of each task based on its requirements and the available microcontroller resources. From further inspection, we discovered that the overall RAM used was determined to be 18% while the flash memory utilized a memory of  


## 3.4 Real World Timing Statistics

When the real-time operating system is running, we decided to consider a realistic operation of the CAN\_TX\_TASK and CAN\_RX\_TASK rather than disabling mailboxes for simplifications. It is also realistic to have all tasks running simultaneously. We hence conducted an analysis by enabling CAN mailboxes and then simply timing the rest of the tasks in the scheduler. After carrying out the FreeRTOS task utilization analysis the following ratios were determined for the percentage of time that the tasks ran.

It appears how CAN\_TX and RX\_TASKS can have a significant effect on the actual timing when it is running within real-time and disabling the mailboxes slightly oversimplifies the analysis step. Additionally, we see that displayUpdate() still gets carried out for an adequate and significant 24% of the duration which is significantly more than the time spent on scankeys() which is expected due to it taking a large duration to display pixels on screen. Overall, this analysis does confirm that all tasks are running smoothly with all tasks being carried out by the operating system. It does indicate however, that some tasks execution times cannot be oversimplified.
