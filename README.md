# Analogue-Music-Synthesizer - Embedded Systems Coursework 2

  # Running The Code
  Navigate to https://github.com/matthew-setiawan/Analogue-Music-Synthesizer/tree/main/src to find main.cpp used to upload software to the board.
  
  # Using the Board
  
  ## Configuring a Board
  - Boards are set to slaves/recievers by default which are unable to edit their volume, wave or octave
  - Twist 2nd knob to the left to make this a master/sender board then you can edit volume, wave and octaves using knobs 1, 3 and 4 respectively.

  ## Connecting an additional Board
  - Warning: before connecting boards with each other make sure that they are all set as slaves or one set as master. If two or more boards are set as master accidently use yellow reset button to reset boards.
  - Upon connection as slaves, set the middle board to master. You will notice the octaves and volumes of left and/or right boards changing respective to the master keyboard, you will also notice the keys being played on the master will also be sent and played by the slaves.

  # Report
  
  This report focuses on the development of an embedded software for a music synthesizer circuit.
  
  The report highlights the solutions leading to a robust real-time programming implementation. More specifically, it details the allocation of functions to tasks, the time characterisation of these tasks, how data is shared and synchronised between these and any deadlocks that may occur. Please see and click the relevant sections in the below table of contents to learn more about our task and implementation.
